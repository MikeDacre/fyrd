description: "Ongoing issues with the local fallback mode"
title:       "Persistent Problems with Local Mode"

It has come to my attention that the local mode is not very stable, it
sometimes takes a very long time to run jobs, and occasionally fails completely
for no good reason. I don't have enough time to fix this in the next few days,
it will probably require a large rewrite. The batch system functionality is
intact though, I will post again when the local mode works.
