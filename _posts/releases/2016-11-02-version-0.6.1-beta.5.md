description: "Version 0.6.1-beta.5 brings a more unified approach to fetching jobs, an API more similar to multiprocessing, and automatic job cleaning"
---
This version represents a large API break and a significant step towards making
fyrd more similar to the multiprocessing library.

The largest change in this version is that way the `Job` objects return
outputs. Previously, `Job.get()` would return `(exitcode, stdout, stderr)`, now
it just returns the output, which is either the function return value, or the
contents of `STDOUT`.

<!--break-->

In addition, now all other variables (`.out`, `.stdout`, `.stderr`, and
`.exitcode`) are saved automatically and the temp files cleaned up by default
after `get()` completes.

The one potential downside is that very large return values get loaded into
memory by default. That can be avoided by using `wait()` instead of `get()`.

Specific changes:

- Make file cleanup the default
- Make `get()` return either function return value or STDOUT.
- Make `.stdout`, `.stderr`, and `.exitcode` handling more robust.
- Add link from `.err` to `.stderr`.
- Alter test suite to work with new output API.
- Add script to make multiple virtualenv testing easier
