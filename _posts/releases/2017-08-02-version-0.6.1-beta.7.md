I have not had much time to work on fyrd in the last few months, so this
release represents fairly minor fixes.

<!--break-->

It is primarily small bug fixes, plus additional stability improvements, a few
other things:

 - We no longer assume that dissapeared jobs means failure, this happens
   sometimes when waiting for a job to finish. We now check if the job output
   files exist when a job disappears, and if they do we assume success. If they
   do not then we assume failure.
 - It is now possible to explicitly set a slurm or torque executable in the
   config file, and doing so will ensure that that executable is used in queue
   detection and parsing, as such a full path to e.g. squeue can be specified.
