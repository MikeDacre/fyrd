All scripts that used to be in `bin/` have been moved into a single
entry-point script called fyrd and are managed as subcommands instead
of as separate scripts.

Scripts with the same name of those previously in `bin/` still remiain, but
they have thus all been converted to shell scripts that are simple aliases of
the relevant `fyrd` subcommands.

<!--break-->

Example usage of the new console script:

```
fyrd conf show
fyrd conf update jobs profile_file ~/fyrd_profiles

fyrd profile show
fyrd prof add high_mem cores:92 mem:250GB partition:high-mem

fyrd wait 2764832 27464896

fyrd queue
fyrd queue -p high-mem
fyrd queue -u jeff
```

For complete documentation of the new console script, see the
[Console Scripts](https://fyrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/console.html)
section of the manual.

<h3>Other Changes</h3>

I made a logo of a Saxon shield of the kind used in fyrds and superimposed a
cluster tree.

In addition, I have completely overhauled the documentation and added the logo.
The documentation now builds sensibly as html and pdf, with the new icon nicely
presented in both, this is the first release with a good
[read the docs](https://fyrd.readthedocs.io) manual.

Finally, to make script outputs easier to read, I now use the tabulate library,
which I have added as a new dependency.
