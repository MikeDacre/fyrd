This folder contains sphinx documentation sources to build documentation for the
whole project.  The documentation already exists at
`<https://mikedacre.github.io/python-cluster>`_ and in the
`PythonCluster.pdf <../PythonCluster.pdf>`_ document in the
root of this repository.

To build it again, just run `make html latexpdf` in this directory, note that
the Makefile is set to write the html help to `../../docs/html`.

You can also create documentation in any format of your choice, just run `make`
in this directory to get a list of possible formats.
